    <div class="text_1">
        <p><br><br><strong>Overcome Evil with Good </strong>
            
            <br><br>In Romans 12:21, Paul writes, “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” It’s a simple sentence, but it packs so much power and truth. In a world full of negativity, judgment, and sometimes downright cruelty, this verse reminds us of our call to shine as lights. It’s about living in a way that others can’t help but see something different in us—God’s love.
            
            <br><br><strong>Selflessness in Action</strong>
            
            <br><br>When Paul talks about overcoming evil with good, it’s more than just “being nice.” It’s about choosing to put others first, even when it’s hard. It’s showing kindness to the person who wronged you, or going out of your way to help someone, even when you’re tired or busy. Being selfless means we stop thinking about what we deserve or what we want, and instead focus on how we can be a blessing to others. It’s counter-cultural, but it’s exactly how we show the world who Jesus is. 
            
            <br><br><strong>Being a Light in Dark Places</strong>
            
            <br><br>Living out Romans 12:21 is all about becoming that light in dark places. It’s not always easy, but that’s where the power of God comes in. People are watching how we respond to challenges. Are we reflecting Christ, or are we just blending in with everyone else? When we choose to respond with love, grace, and selflessness, we become a beacon of hope, pointing people to God without even needing to say a word. 
            
            <br><br><strong>Letting God Work Through You</strong>
            
            <br><br>It’s easy to think that overcoming evil with good is about our own strength, but the truth is we need God’s help. He’s the one who transforms our hearts and gives us the ability to keep loving, keep forgiving, and keep shining. As you surrender your plans and desires to Him, He gives you a bigger purpose—one that isn’t focused on what you can get, but on what you can give. In doing that, you’ll find the ultimate fulfillment, knowing that you’re making a real impact on the world around you. 
            
            <br><br><strong>You Were Made to Shine</strong>
            
            <br><br>At the end of the day, Romans 12:21 is a call to live selflessly and be a light in this world. It’s not always easy, but it’s worth it. God created you with unique gifts and opportunities to shine His light. So, don’t shy away from the challenge—embrace it, and watch how God can use your life to spread His love everywhere you go.</p>

    <p>The story of the stonecutter teaches us valuable lessons about contentment, the nature of true power, and our identity in Christ. Instead of envying others, we are called to recognize our worth in God’s eyes and embrace the roles He has given us, finding joy and fulfillment in serving Him and others.</p>
